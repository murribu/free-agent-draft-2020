Corbin enters free agency as one of the most sought-after starters in the marketplace. His impressive FIP (2.47) combined with his strikeout rate (11.07) and walk rate (2.16) will have teams lining up. He continues to trend in a positive direction in almost every area of his game. And with such a strong platform year, he should become the highest paid left-handed starter in this class, ahead of Dallas Keuchel, J.A. Happ and Gio González.

I’ve said it before: Keuchel has the best beard in baseball, and no one trims it to the level that he does. As it happens, he also is a leader and a winner. While he’s no longer the ace of a staff, he still remains at least a middle-of-rotation starter. Although there have been some subtle signs of decline, the radar gun and many metrics indicate that his average fastball velocity and overall stuff have not gone backward. His ERA was half a run higher this year than last, but his FIP has actually gone down. His strikeout rate has gone down by one strikeout per nine innings, but the biggest difference has been his groundball rate, which has declined over the last two years. However, he still knows how to pitch, and his command of the sinker and slider — under the knees and on both sides of the black — remains elite.

Slash: .246/.352/.449 R: 30 2B: 14 3B: 0 HR: 8 RBI: 23 SB: 2 CS: 0 

Donaldson missed a vast majority of the season with a strained left calf, which will cost him millions in free agency. His trade from the Blue Jays to the Indians on August 31 gave him a month to build back his value. He hit .280 with an on-base percentage of .400 along with three homers and an impressive OPS+ of 146 in those 16 games. Unfortunately, it probably wasn’t a big enough sample size to get him the kind of long-term deal he was hoping for. That being said, remember that Donaldson is only three years removed from being named the AL MVP and, coming into this past year, had averaged 37 home runs per season over his last three seasons. Donaldson could really be a game changer for a contending team like the Cardinals or Angels, both defensively and in the middle of their respective lineups.

Eovaldi has overcome two Tommy John surgeries and a flexor tendon repair and now has the highest velocity of his career, topping out at 102 mph. He was a World Series hero for the Red Sox. Eovaldi started the year with the Rays, going 3-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 10 starts, but after being traded to Boston he went 3-3 with a 3.33 ERA. The improvement was thanks to locating his fastball more often at the top of the strike zone. He made two starts and four relief appearances in the postseason with an impressive 1.61 ERA, punching out 16 and walking 3 in 22 1/3 innings pitched while allowing just 15 hits. His free-agent value definitely spiked with his October domination. Still, his health history will probably deter some teams from offering longer-term contracts. The question now becomes: Does he sign as a starter, a set-up reliever, or even as a closer?

Slash: .256/.342/.509 R: 70 2B: 18 3B: 1 HR: 37 RBI: 97 SB: 1 CS: 0

Cruz arguably has the best eyebrows in the sport. He’s also been one of the most consistent designated hitters over the last five seasons, averaging over 40 homers and 100 RBIs in that span. The six-time All-Star had another solid season in 2018, despite spending time on the disabled list for the first time since 2013 with an ankle sprain. He’ll get paid on a two-year deal from an AL contender, with a return to Seattle being the most likely outcome. David Ortiz was paid $16 million per year the last two years of his deal with the Red Sox back in 2015; Victor Martinez was paid $17 million per year for the last four years of his career. Cruz has been paid $14.25 million for each of the last four years. He probably has earned a slight bump, though not quite to the level of Ortiz or Martinez.

Brantley is finally healthy, and he certainly rewarded the Indians for picking up his club option. Brantley hit over .300 and got on base over 35 percent of the time while belting 17 homers and stealing 12 bags. He also played a solid/average left field.

Morton led the league in hit by pitches for the fourth time in six years, which just shows how badly he wants to own the inside part of the plate. Morton, when healthy, is the best right-handed starting pitcher in this class. He made his first All-Star team this year, and his strikeout rate was the highest of his career at 10.8. He’s only allowed 130 hits in 167 innings while punching out a career-high 201 batters. His mid-90s fastball is explosive, his curveball is a consistent wipeout pitch, and his changeup is flat out nasty and unhittable at times. He did battle right shoulder soreness and injuries throughout the year, which could curb his free-agent value. Teams will have to do in-depth medicals on him, including an MRI, before seriously considering signing him. Without the medicals, it is difficult for me to project more than a one-year deal.

Slash: .257/.316/.484 R: 61 2B: 21 3B: 5 HR: 21 RBI: 65 SB: 13 CS: 2

Pollock has had trouble staying on the field over his seven-year career due to various injuries and has managed to play more than 115 games only twice. He’s still an above-average defender in center with 15-20 home-run power and the ability to steal bases. He was actually an MVP candidate after the first two months of the season, when he belted 11 home runs while getting on base 35 percent of the time before going down with a thumb injury and missing two months of the season. But he did finish the year strong.

McCutchen was an All-Star 2011-15 but hasn’t been to a Midsummer Classic since. He struggled to hit for power with the Giants in that cold, windy park before getting traded to the Yankees. He’s a team leader and always has a strong clubhouse presence. He’d benefit from signing with a team that has a smaller ballpark (or just a good hitters’ park), and with either a developing team that needs veteran leadership or a contending team where he can hit second or sixth in their lineup. He is no longer a .400 on-base percentage player and no longer a 20 stolen-base threat. However, he can still get the big hit and get on base 36 percent of the time, as he has the last two seasons. And keep in mind he’s hit 20 or more home runs in each of his last eight seasons, so there’s reason to believe that his power will endure. McCutchen has also played in 150 games or more in eight of his last nine seasons, and that durability should bump his value, in contrast to Michael Brantley and A.J. Pollock.

Happ went 17-6 this year with the Blue Jays and Yankees, striking out 193 batters in 177 2/3 innings pitched. He has proven once again that he is a solid middle-of-the-rotation starter. Left-handed batters hit just .171 against him, with only two homers in 143 plate appearances. He also was much better in the second half of the season, going 7-0 with a 2.62 ERA in 12 starts, 11 of them with the Yankees.

Lowrie is one of the most underrated second basemen in baseball but finally made his first All-Star Game this year. He had another amazing season, including a .353 on-base percentage with 23 home runs and 99 runs batted in, while playing a solid second base. The A’s would love to have him back next year, but they should expect some serious competition from contending teams after enjoying two of the best years of his career.

Moustakas declined his one-year, $15 million option year for 2019 with the hopes of getting the kind of multi-year offer that he wasn’t able to land last offseason. Moustakas belted 28 home runs, helping the Brewers win the NL Central, but he also had an on-base percentage of .315, and the metrics don’t like his defense at third base as much as the scouts do, which lessens his value. However, he has a reputation as a winning player thanks to his time in Kansas City on two World Series teams, as well as this season, when he helped the Brewers get to Game 7 of the NLCS.

Murphy can flat-out rake, and proved down the stretch that he is completely healthy. The one downside to signing Murphy is that it’s probably time for him to move him off second base for either first base or designated hitter. From 2016-18, he has the second highest batting average in the majors, behind only José Altuve of the Astros. His slash line this year after the All-Star Game was .315/.346/.488. Murphy might not have a lot of teams lining up for him because of his lack of range and limited defensive positions, but his bat is a difference-maker and he should do well on a contract with a contending AL team. I really like Murphy as an upgrade for the Indians at first base, or for the Mariners at designated hitter if they part ways with Nelson Cruz.

The switch-hitter will be this winter’s most sought-after catcher after another solid year that included 24 home runs and an on-base percentage of .349 in 518 plate appearance. Defensively, he did a solid job with game-calling and framing pitches, at least until the postseason, when things seemed to collapse for him. He had several bad games behind the plate in October and temporarily lost his job to Austin Barnes. However, he did get his starting gig back by the end of the World Series and finished strong defensively. The postseason hiccup probably will not cost him in free agency because of the scarcity of quality players at his position, and the fact that he was the starting catcher on a team that got to the World Series for two consecutive years.

González is one of the most versatile players in baseball, capable of above-average defense at first base, second base and in left field, and holds his own on the left side of the infield as well. He got off to a slow start this year, but had a terrific second half, hitting .275/.352/.492; 10 of his 16 home runs came in August and September. He would love to land an everyday job, but that would probably have to come from a second division team — most contenders would likely want to keep him in the same role the Astros had him in. He’s an ideal player for teams like the Cubs and Dodgers, that like to continually use players in different positions.

Surprisingly, however, he didn’t hit for power, belting just one home run after hitting 14 in the first half for Tampa Bay. Teams looking for starting catching this offseason will try to trade for the Marlins’ J.T. Realmuto first, but if that doesn’t work, they will be chasing Grandal and Ramos as the two best catchers available in free agency.

Herrera was leading all closers with a 1.05 ERA when he was traded from the Royals to the Nationals back in June and had recorded 14 saves with a hits per nine rate of only 6.7. However, once he got to Washington, his performance dipped, as shown by his 4.34 ERA and 11.6 hits per nine. His season ended prematurely when he underwent left-foot surgery for a torn Lisfranc ligament. He’s expected to be healthy by the start of spring training, but his free-agent value will take a hit because of the combination of his foot surgery and his rough performance with the Nationals. His contract will probably be a low base with incentives, but it’s difficult to predict without seeing the medicals.

Ottavino has a five-pitch mix, throwing a slider, sinker, cutter, four-seam fastball and occasional changeup. He’s coming off the best year of his career. Ottavino spent the season dominating hitters, striking out 112 in 77 2/3 innings with just 41 hits allowed. Right-handed batters hit only .142 against him, and in his best month, July, he had a 1.35 ERA. He wasn’t as sharp in the season’s last two months, when it jumped above 4.00. However, he will benefit from the increasing number of teams that are putting more and more emphasis on relievers.

Familia led the majors in games finished and saves back in 2016, when he was an All-Star. This past season, he put up similar numbers in terms of FIP, walk and strikeout rates and innings pitched, just without the saves. His value could fluctuate in free agency depending if a team decides to sign him as a set-up reliever or closer.

Robertson’s splits are pretty equal across the board. Right-handed hitters hit .188 against him, while left-handed hitters batted .176. He was more effective in medium-to-high leverage situations, when opposing hitters got on base 23 percent of the time against him, than he was in low-leverage situations, when opponents got on at a 30 percent clip. Teams could sign him as either a set-up reliever or a closer.

Slash: .276/.321/.428 R: 90 2B: 32 3B: 2 HR: 15 RBI: 62 SB: 6 CS: 5

The two-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner is not expected to re-sign with the Rockies next year because their farm system is loaded with top middle-infield prospects, including Brendan Rodgers and Garrett Hampson, both of whom look close to major-league ready. LeMahieu had another solid year, with a career high in home runs, but his batting average and on-base percentage slipped for the third straight season, and he spent time on the disabled list for the first time in four years. His home/road splits will hurt him in free agency, as he slashed .229/.277/.422 away from Coors Field and .317/.360/.433 at home. Still, teams looking to improve their defense at second base will certainly make inquiries. He made $8.5 million in his final year of salary arbitration eligibility, which seems steep considering his lack of overall offensive production. I expect him to take a bit of a pay cut if he signs away from the Rockies.

Kelly had an impressive World Series, dominating hitters with a 97-mph fastball at the top and bottom of the strike zone paired with an incredible wipeout curveball. He ended October 1-0 with a 0.00 ERA, striking out 10 and walking none in six innings of four-hit shutout ball in his five appearances. His stock spiked.

González has thrown at least 170 innings in each of the last four seasons. The hard-throwing lefty has had an inconsistent career, but when he’s on, he has one of the league’s best breaking balls. González was especially effective down the stretch after the Brewers acquired him from the Nationals, going 3-0 with a 2.13 ERA and 3.63 FIP in five starts with his new team. He has had some shoulder issues, which could prevent him from getting a third year in free agency.

Markakis is finally healthy, and it showed on the field, as he had his best season since his prime years in 2008-10. He played in all 162 games for the Braves with above-average defense in right, where he still has plus range and an accurate arm. He did have a poor second half, hitting .258/.332/.369 with only four home runs, which will diminish his value.

Jones had his worst season since 2010, and it marked the first time he didn’t hit 20 home runs after an impressive seven-year run of hitting that mark. He has also declined defensively, to the point that’s it time for him to move to one of the outfield corners. The Orioles were ready to ship Jones to the Phillies, but he utilized his 10-and-5 rights and declined the trade. Jones would have shared time in right field for the Phillies if he had accepted. Expect him to take a massive pay cut and try to be a comeback player of the year candidate with his new team.

Miller battled both knee and shoulder issues this year and wasn’t able to finish strong in the postseason, walking three (one intentional) and giving up a hit in his only 1/3 of an inning of work in two appearances. When healthy, he is one of the best and elite left-handed relief pitchers in the game. However, he’ll probably have to sign a one-year contract loaded with incentives and bonuses and hope he can prove himself healthy next year to regain his earning power.

González took the financial hit last season when his 2017 salary of $20 million was cut all the way down to $5 million after a dramatic decline year, similar to Adam Jones’. González’s 2018 performance indicated that the downward trend is real. I think he’ll get a slight bump in salary in his return to free agency, but it won’t be significant.

K/9: 8.24 W/9: 3.0 BABIP: .295 GB%: 44.4 spin rate: 2250 slider, 2221 cutter

Sabathia had another solid season, and continued to show that he could provide five decent innings in most starts — he consistently kept the Yankees in games. His pitchability is special, and he can still miss bats with the slider.  A return to the Yanks makes the most sense, as a back-of-the-rotation starter. Sabathia’s leadership is important for the development of some of their young pitching prospects.

Sánchez has developed an impressive cutter, which allowed him to pitch better this past year than he ever had in his career. It will be interesting to see if the league adjusts to him next year, or if his age catches up with him. He probably would be best served re-signing with the Braves and seeing if he can continue his surprising success.

Dozier had a dismal free-agent season, setting a career low in batting average while hitting his fewest homers since 2013 with his lowest stolen base total in three years. The former Gold Glove winner will have to sign a one-year deal and hope he gets the opportunity to play enough to regain some value for next year’s free-agent class.

@Brian S. I sense you didn't read the write-up/don't know much about Murphy. It's time for him to be primarily a 1B and DH type player (he was always a first baseman playing 2B anyway.
Also I strongly disagree with the premise that Whit needs to be the second baseman. Part of his skill set is versatility and the Royals should utilize it. There's no sense in entrenching him for 150 games at 2B when he can play any position other than SS and C at a high level.

@Scott T. They don't need a 1st baseman or DH either.

They have Ryan O'Hearn and Jorge Soler that need ABs. Plus they need to keep Sal Perez and his bat in the lineup when they don't want to catch him.

0% chance Murphy comes to KC. They're not spending the cash on a vet when they need to evaluate their young players. Especially the younger infielders like Nicky Lopez, who is knocking the MLB door down.

@Forrest B. He can be moved, yes, but that doesn't mean the Royals need to be spending cash on a 1st base/DH player when they have ample amount of players that already play those positions. The Royals also have about 5-6 OF prospects that they need to evaluate and also have Alex Gordon in LF. There is no room on this rebuilding team for an aging vet that can't move defensively. The Royals also have Nicky Lopez in Omaha who was smashing AAA pitching last year and will get a look this year in KC.

Anyone who closely follows this Royals team knows there is a 0% chance that Daniel Murphy comes to KC and honestly even bringing it up shows a lack of knowledge about the team and how they're going to be ran in 2019.

@Brian A. I follow the Royals very closely and I would actually argue you are the one who is ignoring recent precedent. The Royals brought in Duda, Jay, and Moose last offseason despite being in what DM refuses to call a rebuild. They then flipped Jay for Elvis Luciano who is one of the better pitching prospects in the system and Moose for two of the players worth the most optimism on the MLB roster in Jorge Lopez and Brett Phillips. Daniel Murphy has been one of the best hitters in baseball over the past several years and I'm not willing to write him off as an option because of a 44 game sample from Ryan O'Hearn or Jorge Soler who has consistently shown he is incapable of staying healthy.
To respond to a couple of your other points for the purpose of discussion:
The OF situation: Alex Gordon does not deserve to play against lefties. Brian Goodwin is 28 and has yet to show an extended run of MLB success. Brett Phillips by most scouting reports is probably best suited as a 4th outfielder. Jorge Bonifacio was absolutely dreadful at the plate in 2018, wasn't that good in 2017, and is a poor defensive outfielder. Soler as mentioned above has yet to prove he can stay healthy and 4 full years into his MLB career that should not be ignored. Other than that I think your comment on "5-6 OF prospects" shows a lack of knowledge of the farm system. Khalil Lee's timeline is the end of 2019 if the Royals are aggressive and he proves he can hit upper minors pitching, something he didn't do in 2018 (he was very young for being at AA, not saying he won't be better in 2019). Donnie Dewees is a 4th outfielder at best. Bubba Starling is a bust and can't stay healthy. Elier Hernandez is a non-prospect at this point.
On keeping Sal's bat in the lineup: I love Sal, he's one of the better hitters on the team, but he hasn't posted an OBP north of .300 since 2013 and has only posted a wRC+ of > 100 once since 2013 (103 in 2017). He's a good offensive catcher, a great defensive catcher, and the heart beat of the team, but I just strongly disagree with the notion that they need to keep his bat in the lineup when he isn't catching.
Moral of the story is Daniel Murphy 100% makes the Royals a better team in 2019, and you can never rule out Moore making a move that improves the major league club.
Scott T.
Nov 6, 6:55pm
I also like Nicky Lopez, but I think his prospect status is propped up a bit by Royals fans because he's one of the few guys who the Royals have in the upper minors that is worth tracking. He's got a good skill-set for a middle infielder, but I don't think he'll ever hit for enough talent to be a great MLB player. Good middle infielder? Sure. He also only has 57 games of good, but not great, production at AAA. Keeping him in the minors for even most of 2019 isn't that crazy.
I'm not saying Daniel Murphy is likely for the Royals. I don't think the fit is there because he deserves to play most every day, & probably for a contender. I'm just saying you can't rule out DM making a move that makes the MLB team better in 2019, and Daniel Murphy 100% fits that description. Between 1B/2B/OF/DH there would be plenty of AB's for the incumbents who need them. Murphy would arguably the Royals best hitter and we shouldn't write that off as an option, especially when the back-end guys we're talking about losing AB's are Jorge Bonifacio, Alex Gordon, Brett Phillips, Brian Goodwin, Frank Schwindel, Jorge Soler, Cheslor Cuthbert, etc.

Expect the Jays to be in on JA Happ again as well, especially if its only in the $30m/2yr range. Not sure about Jays interest in Corner OF though but a CF upgrade wouldnt surprise me. Finally I don't really see a fit with Marwin Gonzalez (ironically). The super utility role is filled by, well, most of the IF roster with Gurriel, Drury, Diaz, Urena, even Martin and eventually Tulo. Even if the thinking is that Vlad Jr. Is a 1B/DH type player with this roster configuration, the Jays wouldn't need to add a Marwin Gonzalez type unless they already have takers lined up for Smoak and Morales.

@Bryan W. The answer is no. They won't take that risk at the price he will be demanding. But a healthy Donaldson would be the player that could put the Pirates to the next level. He is a much needed power bat at a position that we are weaker in. It's a shame they won't take that risk.

Not one mention of any of the Top 35 with the Detroit Tigers. I know Chris Illich is a cheapskate and Al Avila is a GM hiding behind a long rebuild for his tenure. However, come on, they have to sign some players to put a better product on the field for 2019 then the crap product they gave us fans in 2017 and 2018. We will be in Year 3 of the rebuild during 2019 and the patience of us Tiger fans will be low. How about home town guy, 2nd baseman DJ Lemahieu for starters?

At one time (two years ago) this free agent class looked like a bull. My, how times have changed. Most of these players are question marks because of health, obviously past their prime or not good fits. After Machado and Harper (don't be surprised if both go to the Phillies along with possibly Kimbrel) it doesn't look so good. However, the team(s) that is looking to fill a hole with platoon possibilities is going to have a field day.

Because they had 4-5 top tier prospects who could play the OF and didn't need to block the position for 8 years. He was completely unnecessary even if he performed at historical levels.

So the move would have been to ride with Soler in 2016, or possibly move one of the infield prospects to RF?

@Chris C. He and Bryant are best friends and have the same agent. The sense I've been getting is that Bryant has let the Cubs know that they are a package deal. If they want him to extend, they need to bring in Harper.

@Alex K. They had Soler in 2016. So I would have gone with OF of Soler, Fowler, and Schwarber. I would have occasionally played Zobrist or Bryant in OF. And IF would have been Rizzo, Baez, Russell, and Bryant. Occasionally Zobrist.

Rather than JHey, would have signed Price. Even outbidding Red Sox. Price would not be "worth" the money but he was only FA on the market and you could afford to overpay. Also might have overpaid for an RP.

2017 on is where real difference is made. With Price on team, you don't need Quintana. So you keep Jimenez.

2017 in OF you have Schwarber, Almora, and Happ playing every day. Zobrist occasionally too. I think those guys would be a lot better than how they look now if they are playing every day. And if not, you can replace one with Zobrist and Jimenez (when he's ready).

From that group of OFs, 3 will develop. That's a core OF that goes approximately 8 years into 2025. Instead of having an aging Heyward on the roster taking up that OF spot and playing time from young kids.

And if they still weren't working out now, then you sign Harper.

MLB Network & Jon Heyman confirmed that the Reds will be in on Corbin and Keuchel. Based on this, it looks like the Reds will at least make an effort to acquire top SP talent. For Reds fans, this an exciting change of pace. Obviously there are a number of hurdles in acquiring talent like this - the depth of our pockets, Great American Small-Park, our recent struggles. Nonetheless, I’m encouraged.

Look at the last 10 years of WS winners. the ones who have repeated were built differently each time. Also, not just big market teams. Houston, KC, SF, and STL all won in that period without huge payrolls. Not to mention, nearly all of the WS winners are built on home grown players or trades with 1-2 big FAs (tops).

Even the Cubs were middle of the pack in payroll in their championship season. 14th. The Giants won their first in a similar spot but by the 3rd one, they were near the top of the league. Success breeds high payrolls to "keep the gang together."

As a Cubs fan...I hope they move Schwarber for pitching. Send him to the AL for a starter or reliever. Sign Andrew McCutcheon to play LF. Then bring in one or two of the following relievers:
- Craig Kimbrel
- Joe Kelly
- Andrew Miller
- Zach Britton
Michael M.

What kind of return would you expect for Schwarber?

@Brian L. Yeah, I would support a move like that. I’ve always liked McCutcheon, but I would prefer Marwin Gonzalez for versatility and age. And I’d substitute Eovaldi for Miller as a set-up/closer. It’s tricky because it seems like every hard thrower has an injury history the Cubs in particular can’t afford to invest in. But I don’t see Morrow staying off the DL.

I would be on board with bringing in Eovaldi. I am a big fan. I would rather see McCutcheon because I am so tired of the “versatility” thing with this Cubs roster.

Just curious. Do you think Schwarber is key because he may have hit his ceiling and his trade value is at its peak or because if a trade has to happen you’d rather protect other guys like Happ and Almora? Or something else?

Schwarber is still a liability defensively. He has certainly improved, but he needs to be a DH in the AL. And, he has more trade value than a Happ or Almora because of the power. I don’t think he will ever hit for average. He could prove me wrong. But, they can get a guy with comparable power numbers with considerably more defensive skills.

If Brian Cashman is listening, PLEASE take the money that you want to throw at Machado & use it instead to sign two starting pitchers, preferably from the Corbin / Keuchel / Eovaldi bin. The last thing that Yankee fans want in the Bronx is an ARod-knockoff (minus the hustle).

There is a lot of useful info compiled into this article, and that takes a lot of work. However, it is one thing to say that over half of MLB's clubs would be interested in Andrew Miller, and quite another to list 17 of them as "best fits" for him, so the commenters who complained about this do have a point. It may be that there just wasn't enough gas in the tank to handicap the contenders for each player, or it may simply have been an impulse toward completeness to list everyone who might be a bidder. If that's the case, calling them "Possible landing spots" rather than "best fits" would raise fewer objections.

Understand that the article is necessarily pretty expansive, and as soon as players begin to sign everything changes.....the thing I find notable is that the Dodgers are considered "fits" for 17 of the 35 players on the list, including just about every setup reliever. Think this is Bowden's way of saying, if the Dodgers really want a guy - they'll get him. Nice to have the TV contract that keeps on giving, even though a lot of Angelenos rarely get to see them.

Excellent work. I was very happy to see that are acknowledging the shift in the marketplace, holding salary growth down to reasonable numbers and shortening contract length. I disagree slightly on the "Big 2" of Harper and Machado. I do not think they will top $300 million, and may actually go for a significantly shorter deal (3-5 years) but with higher AAV. I could see Harper top $40 million a year for 3 or 4 years.
